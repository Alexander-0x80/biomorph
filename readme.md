In his book “[the blind watchmaker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker)”, Richard Dawkins describes a program he wrote to demonstrate the concept of mutations in evolution, given an external selection power.

__The concept :__

* Program starts with a binary tree - one trunk that has 2 branches reaching out of it.
* Tree then generates a number of random “siblings” - each with the same characteristics of it’s parent, but with a slight random mutation on some of its properties (number of branches, number of levels, colors etc). 
* The user then selects one of these siblings to generate a new generation of trees, and so forth. 

The idea is that while each generation has only a small difference between it and its parent and siblings, after a few random generation we can see huge differences and varieties.
